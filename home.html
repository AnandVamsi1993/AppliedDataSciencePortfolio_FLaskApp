    <h2>Hey there, welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>Hey guys, this is Anand and welcome to my portfolio. Would love for you check out what I'm upto. I'm from Hyderabad, India and I am currently in Syracuse, NY pusrusing my graduate studies in Applied Data Sciences. Hopefuly my hat gave it away! <br />
    <br />
    I like solving problems on Leetcode as it challenges me to think better. I am interested in building Intelligent Systems, especially those which are at the intersection of Computer Vision and NLP. I am currently working as a Research Assistant under my Statistics prof
    essor. My other interests include Crossfit, Squash, reading books on spiritual growth, watching Test Matches (yeah, we do exist!) and by the mercy of the US gods, I'm starting to show some interest in NBA. I am a Jason Tatum and a Celtics fan. <br />
    <br />
    Some of the other interest I am looking to explore include surfing, kickboxing and baseball. Do checkout my portfolio for more information on my research and other projects. <br />
